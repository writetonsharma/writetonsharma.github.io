<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span2 " >AGREEMENT AND DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNT TERMS AND RULES AND</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span3 " >REGULATIONS FOR CONSUMER CHECKING ACCOUNTS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2 span1" >&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >&quot;You&quot; and &quot;your&quot; mean the owner(s) of the account. &quot;We&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, and &quot;our&quot; mean The Huntington National Bank.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >This Agreement and Disclosure of Account Terms and Rules and Regulations for Consumer Checking Accounts (the &quot;Rules and Regulations&quot;) applies to any type of checking account you are opening with us except (i) any type of checking account we offer for businesses and (ii) any type of checking account we offer for consumers for which we have separate Rules and Regulations for that type of account. If we are providing you with these Rules and Regulations for an existing account, these Rules and Regulations replace the Rules and Regulations for that existing account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >These Rules and Regulations, the Personal Account Charges Form for the type of checking account you have, the rate sheet for the type of checking account you have (if any), any signature card for your account and any other documents for your account or to access or perform transactions on your account are collectively referred to as the &quot;Account Documents&quot;. The Account Documents collectively constitute the deposit contract for your checking account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >NOTICE OF ARBITRATION PROVISION</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >The Account Documents are subject to an Arbitration Provision which you should read carefully. If a dispute between you and us is arbitrated, the Arbitration Provision will substantially affect your rights, including your right to have a court trial or to bring, join in or participate in a class action.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >ACCOUNT RELATIONSHIP</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we are opening a new checking account for you, you agree to all of the provisions contained in the Account Documents and all of our procedures which govern checking accounts.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we are transferring your funds to a new type of checking account from an existing checking account, which we are closing, your new checking account may have the same account number as the existing checking account it is replacing. Your new checking account is subject to all of the provisions of the Account Documents and all of our procedures which govern checking accounts. If we are responding to your request for information about your existing checking account, then the Account Documents set forth the provisions which govern your existing checking account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we are responding to your request for information about our checking accounts, then we are not opening any account for you and the Account Documents have no legal effect other than to provide information to you. All of the information we provide to you is subject to change.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >TRANSACTION LIMITS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Although you may normally make withdrawals from your account at any time, under applicable federal law we can require you to give us seven days’ prior notice of any withdrawal, including but not limited to any withdrawal by check or by electronic means. The foregoing sentence does not apply to your account if it is a demand deposit account (see “Demand Deposit Accounts” section below).&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Any limitations on electronic funds transfers available for your account are set forth in the agreement and disclosure for that electronic funds transfer service.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You may not use or permit your account to be used to make or participate in illegal transactions or Internet gambling. We will not be liable if you engage in an illegal transaction or Internet gambling. We may reject or deny any transaction, including but not limited to merchant authorization or other electronic inquiries, if we believe there is a reason to do so, including any illegal or Internet gambling transaction.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >CHARGES</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You agree to pay the applicable fees and charges set forth from time to time in the Personal Account Charges Form applicable for the type of account you have. You also agree to pay any fees and charges we assess in connection with garnishments, attachments, levies, support orders, court orders, or other process involving your account. You also agree to pay our fees and charges for additional services in connection with your account. We will not charge an Overdraft Fee for fees and charges assessed into overdraft.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You authorize us to debit all fees and charges from your account, whether or not that causes an overdraft in your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We may from time to time, in our sole discretion, waive certain fees and charges on a one-time, periodic or other basis without changing the terms of these Rules and Regulations or your obligations under these Rules and Regulations and without obligating us to provide similar waivers in the future.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >WHEN FEES ARE INCURRED AND DEBITED</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Monthly fees are incurred at the beginning of the monthly statement period and debited at the end of the statement period. For new</span><span class="f2  span4 " >&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >accounts, monthly fees are incurred when the account is opened. When an account is closed, monthly fees are debited when the account is closed rather than waiting until the end of the statement period. Monthly fees incurred for the monthly statement period in which an account is opened or closed apply for the entire statement period even though the account may be opened for less than a full month during that statement period. However, any monthly fee incurred will be waived if a waiver condition applies. During the monthly statement period in which an account is opened or closed, minimum or average daily balance requirements are computed for the days the account was opened during that statement period.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Activity or transactional fees are incurred when the activity or transaction occurs, and may be debited when the activity or transaction occurs or at the end of the monthly statement period. When an account is closed, activity or transactional fees may be debited when the account is closed if not previously debited during that statement period.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >BONUSES</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we offer any bonus in connection with opening your account, we will provide information about the bonus on a separate document given to you along with these Rules and Regulations.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >MAKING DEPOSITS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You may make deposits to your account in any manner we permit at any time our banking offices or other deposit-taking facilitiesare open. All deposits are made subject to our verification procedures and the terms and conditions on our deposit slip or depository envelope (if any). We may refuse, limit or return deposits for any reason and at any time, including but not limited to, deposits made at our banking offices, or when we or others process the deposit for collection. Any of you may make deposits or, when permitted by law or by the terms of the item, endorse the other’s checks or other items for deposit to your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You authorize us to accept checks and other items and entries (“deposited items”) for deposit to your account if they are made payable to, or to the order of, any one or more of you, whether or not they are indorsed by you. You authorize us to supply missing indorsements and you warrant that all indorsements are genuine. We will act as your agent in collecting the money for deposited items. We will be careful in making collections, but we will not be responsible for losses caused by you or others in the collection process. We may credit your account for the amount of deposited items, subject to actually collecting the money for them. However, subject to applicable federal law and our Funds Availability Policy, we reserve the right to wait until we have actually received the money for deposited items before we credit your account, and to receive deposits subject to special conditions.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we credit your account for the amount of any deposited item and it is returned for any reason, we may debit that amount from your account. We may also charge you a fee for such returned deposited items. We may debit the amount from your account even before a deposited item is returned to us if we have reason to believe it cannot be collected or is being returned. You will be responsible for, and agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from, any liability, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from a deposited item that is returned to us, even after it is initially paid, for an alleged breach of warranty under applicable law or other reason not caused by us, including but not limited to, a claim of forged or unauthorized endorsement, a claim of alteration, or a claim that a remotely created check (a check that does not bear a signature applied, or purported to be applied, by the person on whose account the check is drawn) is not authorized.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If you make a deposit in foreign currency, we will post the transaction in U.S. dollars based on the currency exchange rate we determine is in effect on the day we settle the transaction. The currency exchange rate may be different on that day than on the day we processed the transaction. There may be special currency exchange charges. This may result in your account being posted for a greater or lesser amount than the original amount of the transaction.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >All deposited items must be completed in dark blue or black ink. You may not deposit a substitute check with us unless 1) we otherwise agree in a separate writing with you or 2) a check that you deposit is returned to you as a substitute check for the first time. You will be responsible for, and agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from, any liability, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from a deposited check that is not completed in dark blue or black ink, or a deposited substitute check that violates this paragraph. In addition, you will be responsible for, and agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from, any liability, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from a delay in return caused by any condition of a deposited check arising after it is issued and before we accept it for deposit (including, but not limited to, markings that obscure a properly placed bank endorsement).</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >NIGHT DEPOSITORY</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We provide automated teller machines (ATMs) where you can make deposits, payments, withdrawals or other transactions either during or after business hours for our banking offices. We strongly advise you to use our ATMs, and not our night depository facility, to make deposits or payments after hours. The night depository facility is intended for commercial customers with large after-hours deposits and is not designed to be used by consumer customers.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If you do use the night depository facility, you may only use it to make deposits or payments. You must place the deposit or payment into a fully completed envelope which we make available. If it is unclear to us what to do with the deposit or payment, we may credit it to any account you have with us. If we do not find your deposit or payment in the night depository, it shall be conclusively presumed that the deposit or payment was not placed in the night depository, and we have no responsibility or liability for it. We likewise are not responsible or liable for any loss of deposits or payments caused by fire, flood, water damage, vandalism, burglary or acts of God. We may cease availability of a night depository at any time without notice to you.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >WITHDRAWALS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Except as otherwise limited by these Rules and Regulations, withdrawals from your account may be made in person, by writing checks or in any other manner we permit. Transfers from your account are withdrawals.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >All checks must be on forms you get from us or that we approve. You must complete the check in dark blue or black ink. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, we will charge against your account any postdated check you have written even if it is presented before the date of the check.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Subject to applicable federal law and our Funds Availability Policy, we reserve the right to refuse to pay any check or permit any other withdrawal if there is not a sufficient amount of money in your account that has been collected or if we have not learned that collection is final. We may charge a fee to the person to whom you wrote a check if that person attempts to negotiate the item with us but does not have an account with us.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We are not responsible to take action on, or for failure to notify you of restrictive language placed on checks or other items, including but not limited to terms such as “void after 90 days”, “paid in full”, “two signatures required”, “void over $100” or similar statements. In accordance with reasonable banking standards, most checks and other items are processed through automated processing systems and, except in limited circumstances and in our discretion, most items are not individually examined. You agree that we act within reasonable banking standards by processing most checks and other items through automated processing systems.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We will treat each deposit and withdrawal as having been made on the day we post it to your account. We may treat any deposit or withdrawal made on a day that is not a business day (such as Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, even if we are open on those days) or after our cut-off time on any business day as if made on our next business day.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >OVERDRAFTS AND RETURNS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If there is not enough money in your account to cover a transaction presented to us, we may, in our sole discretion, either pay it and cause an overdraft or return it (bounce a check, for example). In either case, we may charge you a fee as explained under “Fees for Overdrafts and Returns” below. You have no right to overdraw your account, and no course of dealing, usage of trade, or bank policy or procedure establishes a right for you to overdraw your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You can avoid having insufficient funds in your account if you practice good account management and maintain sufficient available funds in your account to cover all transactions to be paid or debited from your account. In figuring if you have sufficient available funds, you need to take into consideration all of your transactions, including those which may not yet have been presented to us for payment or settlement. Examples of such transactions are checks, withdrawals, transfers, purchases, payments or other debits. Special rules may apply for certain pending transactions (see “Special Rules for Pending Transactions” below). Transactions affecting your account are presented to us all during the business day. We do not completely know all transactions that will be presented for any given business day until we finish processing after the end of that business day. Thus, during the business day, only you know all of your transactions that may affect your account balance for that business day.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we allow an overdraft on your account, you must pay us immediately for the amount of the overdraft and any fees we charge in connection with the overdraft. If we return the item or entry, you must pay us any fees we charge in connection with returning it. By making or allowing deposits to your account, you agree that we may use such deposits to reduce or eliminate any overdraft balance in your account, including, but not limited to, any fees in connection with any overdraft or return of any transaction. We will not be responsible for damages or wrongful dishonor if any transaction is returned or otherwise not paid because your account does not have enough funds.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >FEES FOR OVERDRAFTS AND RETURNS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We charge fees for paying overdraft transactions or for returning them. However, we will not charge any fees resulting from paying overdrafts for ATM and one-time (everyday) debit card transactions if you have previously opted out of debit overdraft service (see the separate form “What You Need to Know about Overdrafts and Overdraft Fees”).</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >In most cases, if we authorize an ATM or one-time (everyday) debit card transaction, we are required by card network rules to pay it when it settles, even if that causes your account to overdraw. If you have opted in to debit overdraft service, we may charge you an Overdraft Fee if that happens. If you have opted out of debit overdraft service, we must still pay the item into overdraft if card network rules require us to do so, but we cannot charge you an Overdraft Fee. However, if you do not opt in to debit overdraft service, we will generally deny an authorization request if at the time of authorization, the authorization amount would overdraw your account.We determine the amount of the fee for overdraft or returned transactions on any given day based on the total number of occurrences during the 1-year period ending and including that day. The amount we charge for overdraft fees and return fees is shown on our Personal Account Charges Form. An “occurrence” means a day for which there is at least one transaction in your account to cover when your account does not have enough funds, whether we pay or return the transaction and whether or not we charge a fee. We also charge an extended overdraft fee if your account remains overdrawn for an extended period. See our Personal Account Charges Form for the amount of this fee.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >SPECIAL RULES FOR PENDING TRANSACTION</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Certain transactions, such as debit card purchases and ATM transactions, have a two-step process that can affect availability of funds in your account to pay other items. These transactions usually first have an electronic authorization request, which is followed on the same day or in the next few days by an electronic request for settlement.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >The amount of the authorization request may not be available to cover other transactions pending final settlement. This can cause other transactions to be returned unpaid or to overdraw your account. However, we will not charge an Overdraft Fee or a Return Fee if there would have been enough available funds in your account but for the pending authorization request. However, if we return other transactions unpaid, that may have other adverse consequences for you, such as fees charged by the payee of the returned transaction. When the debit card purchase or ATM transaction is finally settled, it can cause your account to overdraw if there are not enough funds in your account at the time of settlement. This may cause an Overdraft Fee if you have opted in to debit overdraft coverage (see “Fees for Overdrafts and Returns” above).</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Consider the following example: Assume you start the day with an account balance of $50, during the day you make a debit card purchase of $35 that we authorize as a pending transaction. Later that day a check for $30 you wrote a few days ago is presented to us for payment. The pending debit card authorization reduces the available funds in your account to $15, which is not enough to pay the $30 check. We may, depending on criteria we establish, and your opt in/out preferences for debit overdraft coverage, do one of the following:</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >Return the check, but not charge you a Return Fee, since there would have been enough in your account to pay the check, exceptfor the $35 pending debit card authorization. (If the check had been for $55—more than your account balance—and we returnedit, we would charge you a Return Fee.) If we return the $30 check, assuming no other transactions, your account balance on the next business day (without considering the $35 pending debit card authorization) will still be $50. If the $35 debit card purchase is presented to us for final settlement on that next business day, it would reduce your account balance to $15, and your account would not be overdrawn.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >Pay the check and not charge you an Overdraft Fee, since there would have been enough in your account to pay the check, except for the $35 pending debit card authorization. (If the check had been for $55—more than your account balance—and we paid it, we would charge you an Overdraft Fee.) If we pay the $30 check, assuming no other transactions, your account balance on the next business day (without considering the $35 pending debit card authorization) will be $20. If the $35 debit cardpurchase is presented to us for final settlement on that next business day, generally we are required to pay it under debit card network rules. However, that will cause your account to overdraw ($20 minus $35) and your account balance will be negative $15. In that case, we will charge an Overdraft Fee, unless you have previously opted out of debit overdraft service.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >POSTING ORDER</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Posting order is a very complex process, involving many hundreds of types of transactions. Generally, however, on any given business day, we post deposits and credits first, followed by various categories of withdrawals, payments, transfers and other debits, with fees and interest (if any) posted at the end. Within the various categories of debits:</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We post certain electronic transactions that have a valid date/time stamp authorization in chronological order, such as most debitcard purchases and ATM withdrawals and transfers.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We post most checks in check number order, with exceptions for certain checks that we are not able to return.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We post other items, entries and transactions in low-to-high order based on amount within their specific categories.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If there are not enough available funds in your account to cover all transactions to be paid or debited from your account on a given day, the posting order we establish will determine which ones we are able to pay or debit from available funds. The posting order can affect which transactions overdraw your account or are returned/denied, as well as the amount of related Overdraft Fees and ReturnFees we charge you.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >OUR LIABILITY</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Except as otherwise provided for electronic fund transfers by applicable law or by other agreements applicable to your account, you agree that:</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >If we do not properly complete a transaction according to these Rules and Regulations, we will not be liable for losses or damages in excess of the amount of the transaction.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We will not be liable if circumstances beyond our control prevent the transaction or if the funds in your account are or may be subject to legal process or other claim.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We will not be liable for any consequential damages.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >You are responsible for the condition of a check or other item when you issue it. If a check or item is returned or payment is delayed as a result of any writing or marking that you or a prior indorser placed on the front or back of the check or item, you will be responsible for any cost and liabilities in connection with such return or delay.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >STATEMENTS AND TRANSACTION HISTORY</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We will provide you with periodic statements showing the activity on your account. Daily transaction activity may also be viewed online if you are an online banking customer, or through other mobile or digital methods we make available. It is your duty to review your statements and transaction history promptly to determine and report to us whether there are unauthorized transactions, fraudulent activity, forgeries, alterations, missing deposits, or any other errors (all such activity referred to as “errors”) with regard to your account. We are not required to return your cancelled checks or other items with your statements or otherwise. If we do return them, or provide access to them online or otherwise, you should review those promptly for errors as well.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Except as otherwise provided for electronic fund transfers by applicable law or by other agreements applicable to your account, if you fail to notify us of errors in the manner specified below within 30 days after the date your statement is mailed or otherwise made available to you:</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We will have no liability for such errors nor be required to reimburse you for them.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >We will have no liability for (i) any additional error or errors by the same wrongdoer or (ii) any loss that we could have avoided if you had promptly notified us.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Your notice of error must be provided by calling us at 800-480-2265 or writing to us at The Huntington National Bank, Attention: Customer Service, P.O. Box 1558, Columbus, Ohio 43272.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Moreover, no legal proceeding or action for errors may be brought against us more than one year after the statement showing such errors has been mailed or otherwise made available to you.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >WHERE YOUR ACCOUNT IS MAINTAINED</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Although you may transact business on your account at any of our banking offices in any state, you agree that your account is maintained at the banking office where your account is opened. If you do not open your account through one of our banking offices, but do so remotely through the Internet or other mobile or electronic method, our telephone banking facility or some other means, your account will be maintained in Columbus, Ohio, unless we assign your account to a different banking office in another area, region, or state. We may change where your account is maintained if we determine that it is appropriate to do so.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >ACCOUNT OWNERSHIP</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >The ownership of your account and the manner in which your account is held are established by the signature card or, if we no longer use a signature card, such other document or record that we use to identify ownership (referred to in these Rules and Regulations as the “signature card”). If the signature card for your account is lost or unavailable or ownership cannot be determined from the signature card, we will use other evidence available in our records, as we determine, to identify ownership and the manner in which your account is held.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >JOINT ACCOUNTS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >Two or more individuals may open a joint account. We may allow any of you to:</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >Deposit to your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >•&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >Pledge the entire account or any portion of it to secure any of the obligations of any of you.</span></div>

<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We do not have to consider the source of funds in your account when we allow you to do any of these things. You agree that any withdrawal by any of you is presumed to be for the benefit of each of you. You also agree that, when permitted by law or by the terms of the item, each of you may endorse the other&#39;s checks or other items for deposit.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If we believe there is a dispute between joint account owners or if we receive inconsistent instructions from joint account owners, we may suspend or close the account, require a court order to act, and/or require that all joint account owners agree in writing to any transactions concerning the account. If one or more of the joint owners becomes a ward of a guardianship, conservatorship or similar proceeding, we may require all remaining joint owners and the guardian/conservator to divide the money in the account and open a separate account for the ward.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >JOINT ACCOUNT SURVIVORSHIP RIGHTS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >If your account is in two or more names, each of you agrees that it is a joint account with right of survivorship. If one of you dies, the balance in the account may be paid to the survivor. If there is more than one survivor, the balance in the account may be paid to any of them. The survivors will still have rights of survivorship. We may make any payment referred to in this paragraph regardless of the source of the funds in your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >LIABILITY OF JOINT ACCOUNT OWNERS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Any money deposited in a joint account by any of you is subject to being garnished or levied upon by the creditors of any of you, and is subject to our right of set-off, regardless of who owned the money, or the manner in which such money was owned, prior to being deposited to your account. This is true even if the one of you owing us or the other creditor money is different than the one of you who deposited the money. This is also true even if the one of you owing us or the other creditor money was made a joint owner only for signing, convenience, or other purpose. We may use the money in your account to satisfy any garnishment, attachment, levy or similar process against any one or more of you, regardless of the source of the funds in your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >FORMAL TRUST ACCOUNTS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >A formal trust account is an account held by one or more trustees for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries under a written trust agreement separate from your account. Upon our request, the trustee(s) must provide us with a complete copy of any trust agreement affecting your account, or such other document or certification that applicable law permits us to rely on as a summary or description of the trust. We act only as a custodian of the trust funds on deposit in your account. We are under no obligation to act as a trustee or to inquire as to the powers or duties of the trustee(s). The trustee(s) and/or any person opening your account, in their individual capacity and jointly and severally, agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless from and against any and all loss, costs, damage or liability (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees) we may suffer or incur arising out of any action or claim by any beneficiary or other trustee with respect to the authority or actions taken by the trustee(s) in handling or dealing with your account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >INFORMAL TRUST ACCOUNTS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We may allow your account to be held as an informal trust account. An informal trust account (also known as a “Totten Trust”) is an account owned by a trustee and shown as a trust account on our records, but without a written trust agreement separate from your account. The beneficiaries of an informal trust account have no right to any funds in the account during the lifetime of the trustee. The trustee is the owner of the account and may withdraw money from the account and may, by written direction to us, change the beneficiary under the account. Upon the death of the trustee, the account is then owned by the named beneficiary or beneficiaries in our records. If there is no surviving beneficiary, applicable state law will determine ownership of the funds in the account. If the account is held by more than one trustee, the trustees are subject to the provisions of these Rules and Regulations applicable to joint account ownership.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ON DEATH</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We may allow your account to be made payable on death (&quot;POD&quot;), if all of the account owners are natural persons and all of such persons sign the POD agreement on the signature card for this account. Any change of designated payees in the POD agreement must be signed by all account owners and delivered to us on a special form we will give you. While any of the account owners are living, no designated payee has any rights with respect to your account. If any of the account owners pledge the account to secure any obligations, that pledge shall take precedence over the interest of any designated payee.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >ACCOUNTS FOR MINORS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We may allow you to establish the account as a custodian for a minor beneficiary under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act or the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act or similar law applicable in your state (the “Minors Act”). If so, your rights and duties are governed by the Minors Act. You are not permitted to pledge the account as collateral for any loan to you. Deposits in the account are held by us for the exclusive right and benefit of the minor. The custodian and/or any person opening the account, in his or her individual capacity, agrees to indemnify us and hold us harmless from and against any and all loss, costs, damage or liability (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees) we may suffer or incur arising out of any action or claim by any beneficiary or other custodian with respect to the authority or actions taken by the custodian in handling or dealing with the account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We may allow this account to be opened in the name of a minor jointly with a person who is not a minor. In such case, the account is treated as a joint account as provided in these Rules and Regulations, except that the accountholder who is not a minor is responsible for all transactions and other activity on the account by the minor. The accountholder who is not a minor agrees to indemnify us and hold us harmless from and against any and all loss, costs, damage or liability (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees) we may suffer or incur arising out of any claim with respect to the authority of the minor to perform transaction or otherwise conduct activity on the account.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We may also allow this account to be opened individually or jointly in the name of a minor or minors without also having an accountholder who is not a minor and without a custodian for a minor beneficiary under the Minors Act if applicable law so permits and if it is our policy to do so. If we open such an account, you agree that you will be obligated under these Rules and Regulations, and under all of the Account Documents, to the full extent permitted by applicable law. You also agree that any transaction or activity you perform or conduct after you become of age and are no longer a minor is a ratification of all transactions and activity on the account by you or any other accountholder during the time you were a minor. If there is more than one minor on this account, each minor on the account to come of age has the obligations set forth in the preceding paragraph with respect to any accountholder who is still a minor.</span></div>

<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >FOR CHECKING ACCOUNTS THAT PAY INTEREST:&nbsp;</span><span class="f2  span4 " >If your account pays interest, the following additional provisions apply to your account:</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >RATE INFORMATION</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >The current interest rate(s) and annual percentage yield(s) we pay on your account, and minimum balances to earn each rate, are shown on the current rate sheet which we are providing to you at the same time as these Rules and Regulations. If your account does not pay interest, we will not provide you with a rate sheet.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We compute interest at a daily periodic rate of 1/365th (1/366th in a leap year) of the applicable annual rate for each day.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >The interest rate or rates and annual percentage yield may change at any time at our discretion without notice to you.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Interest will be compounded and paid on a monthly basis. Interest will be paid by adding it to your account (less any amount required to be withheld).</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >BALANCE COMPUTATION METHOD</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >We use the daily balance method to calculate the interest on your account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principalbalance in your account at the end of each day, less the amount of any items for which we have not begun to accrue interest asdescribed below, to determine the interest earned for that day. We then add together the interest earned for each day in the statement period to determine the amount of interest to pay you for that statement period.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >WHEN INTEREST BEGINS TO ACCRUE ON NON-CASH DEPOSITS</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >Interest begins to accrue no later than the business day we are deemed to receive credit for the deposit of non-cash items (for example, checks). However, we are not required to pay interest on items that are returned for insufficient funds or for another reason, even if we have begun to accrue interest on that item. We may debit your account for interest that we have previously paid on such returned items.</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f3  span4 " >MINIMUM BALANCE TO EARN INTEREST</span></div>
<div class="normal div4" ><span class="f2  span4 " >The principal balance you must have in your account at the end of the day to qualify to earn any interest for that day is stated in the Personal Account Charges Form currently applicable for the type of account you have. If you qualify, we compute interest for that day using the current interest rate for which your principal balance at the end of the day qualifies you.</span></div>
